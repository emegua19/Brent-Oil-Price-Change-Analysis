## Introduction

This project analyzes Brent oil prices (1987–2022) to identify structural breaks using Bayesian change point detection with PyMC3. Task 1 focuses on data preparation, event compilation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to establish a robust foundation for modeling. The objective is to link price changes to geopolitical, economic, and OPEC events, providing insights for investors, policymakers, and energy companies.

## Task 1 Progress

### Data Preprocessing

Using `src/data_preparation/preprocess.py`, we:

* Loaded Brent oil price data from `data/raw/brent_oil_prices.csv`
* Converted dates to datetime format
* Computed daily log returns to stabilize variance
* Saved processed data with `Date`, `Price`, and `LogReturn` to `data/processed/brent_oil_log_returns.csv`
* Validated format and return calculation via unit tests in `tests/test_preprocess.py`

### Event Dataset

We compiled 15 significant geopolitical, economic, and OPEC events from 2012–2022 (some earlier for context), saved in `data/processed/events.csv`.

#### Table: Key Geopolitical and Economic Events Impacting Brent Oil Prices

| Date       | Event Description                              | Event Type    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 2012-01-01 | Iran threatens Strait of Hormuz closure        | Geopolitical  |
| 2014-06-01 | ISIS captures oil fields in Iraq               | Geopolitical  |
| 2014-11-27 | OPEC decides against production cut            | Economic/OPEC |
| 2015-07-14 | Iran nuclear deal reached                      | Geopolitical  |
| 2016-01-16 | Iran sanctions lifted                          | Geopolitical  |
| 2016-11-30 | OPEC agrees to production cut                  | Economic/OPEC |
| 2018-05-08 | US withdraws from Iran nuclear deal            | Geopolitical  |
| 2019-09-14 | Saudi Aramco drone attack                      | Geopolitical  |
| 2020-01-03 | US airstrike kills Iranian general             | Geopolitical  |
| 2020-03-06 | OPEC+ fails to agree on cuts; price war begins | Economic/OPEC |
| 2020-04-12 | OPEC+ agrees to historic production cut        | Economic/OPEC |
| 2021-01-20 | US rejoins Paris Climate Agreement             | Policy        |
| 2022-02-24 | Russia invades Ukraine                         | Geopolitical  |
| 2022-03-02 | EU imposes sanctions on Russia                 | Geopolitical  |
| 2022-03-31 | US releases strategic petroleum reserve        | Policy        |

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted in `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb`, generating:

* **Price Trends**: Shows Brent oil price history with major peaks and crashes (e.g., 2014 peak, 2020 crash).
* **Log Returns**: Visualizes daily log returns and highlights volatility clustering during global events.
* **Event Overlays**: Event markers placed on price charts to visualize potential impact (e.g., 2022 Russia-Ukraine war).
* **Stationarity Tests**: ADF tests confirm that prices are non-stationary (p > 0.05) but log returns are stationary (p < 0.05).

#### Figures:

* `img/brent_price_trend.png`: Brent Oil Price Trends (1987–2022)
* `img/log_returns.png`: Daily Log Returns of Brent Oil Prices
* `img/price_with_events.png`: Brent Oil Prices with Key Events

## Planned Steps

### Task 1 (Completed)

* Preprocessed Brent oil price data
* Compiled and structured 15 key events
* Created EDA with key visualizations and stationarity tests
* Added unit tests for validation

### Task 2: Bayesian Modeling (Planned: August 4–6, 2025)

* Implement change point detection using PyMC3 in `src/analysis/change_point_model.py`
* Save change points to `results/change_points.csv`
* Match and save related events to `results/matched_events.csv`

### Task 3: Dashboard Development (Planned: August 7–10, 2025)

* Develop Flask API in `src/backend/app.py` to serve model output
* Build interactive React dashboard in `src/frontend/`
* Deploy locally or to a cloud environment

---

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Assumptions

* Log returns better stabilize data for structural break modeling (confirmed by ADF test)
* The curated events are major influencers of price shifts

### Limitations

* Limited to 15 major events; smaller events may be excluded
* Event-price correlations do not imply causation (VAR models could improve analysis)
* Daily data granularity may miss intraday impacts

---

## Communication Plan

* Weekly progress updates via `#all-week10` Slack channel
* Interim submission includes:

  * `reports/interim_report.pdf`
  * `data/processed/events.csv`
  * [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/emegua19/Brent-Oil-Price-Change-Analysis)
* Final deliverables due August 10, 2025:

  * Final report
  * Interactive dashboard
  * Presentation

---

## Conclusion

Task 1 successfully established the data pipeline, event dataset, and EDA framework. The project is on schedule for completing the Bayesian modeling and dashboard deployment phases.
